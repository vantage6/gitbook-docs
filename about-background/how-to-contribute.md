# How to contribute

## :woman\_technologist: If you're a developer

{% hint style="success" %}
Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt), and get in touch with the _infrastructure developers._

### Fixing issues or adding features

Whenever you found an issue and wrote a fix or when you just want to help improving the code, where happy that you want to contribute to the code base. The process to submit a fix would be as follows:

1. Create an [issue ](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues)on the Github page.
2. Create a branch starting with `/bugfix` in the case of a bug, or with `/feature` in the case of a new feature.
3. Implement your fix.
4. Push the branch and open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pulls).

Then it is out of your hands for now. A reviewer will look at the issue and code and will request changes if needed. Once the code is finalized it will be released as soon as possible (depening on the implications this could be released as a patch version).

### Maintenance&#x20;

* A great way to learn about the source is writing unit-tests to test existing components. This helps us getting our [coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/vantage6/vantage6) up.
* Maintaining good [code quality](https://app.codacy.com/gh/vantage6/vantage6/dashboard) is important, so do some housekeeping, refactoring and cleaning really helps us writing good code.
* Writing documentation, both in the code and on this Documentation page.

## :man\_scientist: If you're a tester (and breaker)

* Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/tR7tqCt),  and get into the Development section.
* Feel free to install our development version of vantage6 and try to break it.
* Issues can be reported on our [Github page](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6).

## :police\_officer: If you're into security, privacy&#x20;

One of the top priorities of vantage6 is being secure in what it does. Therefore having people reporting possible security issues to us is immensely helpful. If you have security concerns please report them directly to [f.martin@iknl.nl](mailto:f.martin@iknl.nl) or [b.vanbeusekom@iknl.nl](mailto:b.vanbeusekom@iknl.nl).
