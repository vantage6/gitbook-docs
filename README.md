## What is vantage6? :train2:

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/HVHvlkAeuD0" %}
This work was presented as a contribution during the [AMIA 2020 Virtual Annual Symposium](https://www.amia.org/amia2020). \
It was accompanied by an oral presentation, which you can watch right here as well (\~9 min, in English)
{% endembed %}

Vantage6 stands for pri**va**cy preservi**n**g [federa**t**ed le**a**rnin**g**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated\_learning) infrastructur**e** for **s**ecure **i**nsight e**x**change.

The project is inspired by the [Personal Health Train](https://pht.health-ri.nl/) (PHT) concept. In this analogy vantage6 is the _tracks_ and _stations._ Compatible algorithms are the _trains,_ and computation tasks are the _journey_.&#x20;

vantage6 is here for:

* delivering algorithms to data stations and collecting their results
* managing users, organizations, collaborations, computation tasks and their results
* providing control (security) at the data-stations to their owners

vantage6 is _not_ (yet):

* formatting the data at the data station
* aligning data across the data stations
* a finished/polished product

vantage6 is designed with three fundamental functional aspects of Federated learning.

1. **Autonomy**. All involved parties should remain independent and autonomous.
2. **Heterogeneity**. Parties should be allowed to have differences in hardware and operating systems.
3. **Flexibility**. Related to the latter, a federated learning infrastructure should not limit the use of relevant data.
