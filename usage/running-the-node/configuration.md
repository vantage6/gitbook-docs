# Configure

The vantage6-node requires a configuration file to run. This is a `yaml` file with a specific format.  To create an initial configuration file, start the configuration wizard via: `vnode new` . You can also create and/or edit this file manually.

The directory where the configuration file is stored depends on your operating system (OS). It is possible to store the configuration file at **system** or at **user** level. By default, node configuration files are stored at **user** level. The default directories per OS are as follows:

| **Operating System** | **System-folder**                            | **User-folder**                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows              | `C:\ProgramData\vantage\node`                | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\vantage\node`              |
| MacOS                | `/Library/Application Support/vantage6/node` | `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/vantage6/node` |
| Linux                | `/etc/vantage6/node`                         | `/home/<user>/.config/vantage6/node`                      |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The command `vnode` looks in certain directories by default. It is possible to use any directory and specify the location with the `--config` flag. However, note that using a different directory requires you to specify the `--config` flag every time!
{% endhint %}

## Configuration file structure

Each node instance (configuration) can have multiple environments. You can specify these under the key `environments` which allows four types: `dev` , `test`,`acc` and `prod` . If you do not want to specify any environment, you should only specify the key `application` (not within `environments`) .

{% hint style="success" %}
We use [DTAP for key environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,\_testing,\_acceptance\_and\_production). In short:

* `dev` Development environment. It is ok to break things here
* `test` Testing environment. Here, you can verify that everything works as expected. This environment should resemble the target environment where the final solution will be deployed as much as possible.
* `acc` Acceptance environment. If the tests were successful, you can try this environment, where the final user will test his/her analysis to verify if everything meets his/her expectations.
* `prod` Production environment. The version of the proposed solution where the final analyses are executed.

## Configure using the Wizard

The most straightforward way of creating a new server configuration is using the command `vnode new` which allows you to configure the most basic settings.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/vnodenew (1).jpg>)

By default, the configuration is stored at user level, which makes this configuration available only for your user. In case you want to use a system directory you can add the `--system` flag when invoking the `vnode new` command.

## Update configuration

To update a configuration you need to modify the created `yaml` file. To see where this file is located, you can use the command `vnode files` . Do not forget to specify the flag `--system` in case of a system-wide configuration or the `--user` flag in case of a user-level configuration.

## Local test setup

Refer to [here ](../running-the-server/server-configuration.md#local-test-setup)if you want to run both the node and server on the same machine.
