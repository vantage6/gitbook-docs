description: A Python client to interact with the vantage6 server
---

# Python client

It is assumed you installed the [vantage6-client](../../../installation/client.md). The Python client aims to completely cover the vantage6-server communication possibilities. It can create computation tasks and collect their results, manage organizations, collaborations, users, etc. The server hosts an API which the client uses for this purpose.

For tutorials on how to use the clients, please visit our discourse pages: [https://vantage6.discourse.group/c/tutorials/](https://vantage6.discourse.group/c/tutorials/).

We only show a few examples here. The methods in the library are all documented in their docstring, you can view them using `help(...)` , e.g. `help(client.user.create)` will show you the parameters needed to create a new user. We also have more extensive tutorials on how to use the clients available on our discourse pages: [https://vantage6.discourse.group/c/tutorials/](https://vantage6.discourse.group/c/tutorials/) and in the [Authentication page](authentication.md) and subsequent pages, which follow after introducing our R client.

The following groups (related to the [concepts](../../preliminaries.md#concepts)) of methods are available, most of them have a `list()`, `create()`, `delete()` and `get()` method attached.

* `client.user`
* `client.organization`
* `client.rule`
* `client.role`
* `client.collaboration`
* `client.task`
* `client.result`
* `client.util`
* `client.node`

## Example

```python
help(client.task.create)
#Create a new task
#
#    Parameters
#    ----------
#    collaboration : int
#        Id of the collaboration to which this task belongs
#    organizations : list
#        Organization ids (within the collaboration) which need
#        to execute this task
#    name : str
#        Human readable name
#    image : str
#        Docker image name which contains the algorithm
#    description : str
#        Human readable description
#    input : dict
#        Algorithm input
#    data_format : str, optional
#        IO data format used, by default LEGACY
#    database: str, optional
#        Name of the database to use. This should match the key
#        in the node configuration files. If not specified the
#        default database will be tried.
#
#    Returns
#    -------
#    dict
#        Containing the task information
```
