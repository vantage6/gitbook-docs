# Server API

The server API is documented on the URL:

{% swagger method="get" path="/apidocs" baseUrl="https://SERVER[/api_path]" summary="View the API documentation of the server you are using" %}
{% swagger-description %}

{% endswagger-description %}
{% endswagger %}

For Petronas, the API docs can thus be found at [https://petronas.vantage6.ai/apidocs](https://petronas.vantage6.ai/apidocs). This page will show you which API endpoints exist and how you can use them. All endpoints communicate via HTTP requests, so you can communicate with them using any platform or programming language that supports HTTP requests.
