# User Interface

The User Interface (UI) is a web application that aims to make it easy to interact with the server. At present, it provides all functionality except for creating tasks. We aim to incorporate this functionality in the near future.

Using the UI should be relatively straightforward. There are buttons that should help you e.g. create a collaboration or delete a user. If anything is unclear, please contact us via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yAyFf6Y).
