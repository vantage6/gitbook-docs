# Configure

The vantage6-server requires a configuration file to run. This is a `yaml` file with specific contents. You can create and edit this file manually. To create an initial configuration file you can also use the configuration wizard: `vserver new`.

The directory where to store the configuration file depends on you operating system (OS). It is possible to store the configuration file at **system** or at **user** level. By default, server configuration files are stored at **system** level. The default directories per OS are as follows:

| **OS**  | **System**                                      | **User**                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows | `C:\ProgramData\vantage6\server`                | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\vantage6\server\`             |
| MacOS   | `/Library/Application Support/vantage6/server/` | `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/vantage6/server/` |
| Ubuntu  | `/etc/xdg/vantage6/server/`                     | `~/.config/vantage6/server/`                                 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The command `vserver` looks in certain directories by default. It is possible to use any directory and specify the location with the `--config` flag. However, note that using a different directory requires you to specify the `--config` flag every time!
{% endhint %}

## Configuration file structure

Each server instance (configuration) can have multiple environments. You can specify these under the key `environments` which allows four types: `dev` ,`test`, `acc` and `prod` . If you do not want to specify any environment, you should only specify the key `application` (not within `environments`) .

{% hint style="success" %}
We use [DTAP for key environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,\_testing,\_acceptance\_and\_production). In short:

* `dev` Development environment. It is ok to break things here
* `test` Testing environment. Here, you can verify that everything works as expected. This environment should resemble the target environment where the final solution will be deployed as much as possible.
* `acc` Acceptance environment. If the tests were successful, you can try this environment, where the final user will test his/her analysis to verify if everything meets his/her expectations.
* `prod` Production environment. The version of the proposed solution where the final analyses are executed.

## Configuration wizard

The most straightforward way of creating a new server configuration is using the command `vserver new` which allows you to configure most settings. See the [#structure](server-configuration.md#structure "mention") what each setting represents.

![screenshot when the command vserver new is invoked.](<../../.gitbook/assets/vservernew (1).jpg>)

By default, the configuration is stored at system level, which makes this configuration available for _all_ users. In case you want to use a user directory you can add the `--user` flag when invoking the `vserver new` command.

## Update configuration

To update a configuration you need to modify the created `yaml` file. To see where this file is located you can use the command `vserver files` . Do not forget to specify the flag `--system` in case of a system-wide configuration or the flag `--user` in case of a user-level configuration.

## Local test setup

If the nodes and the server run at the same machine, you have to make sure that the node can reach the server.&#x20;

**Windows and (intel) Mac**\
****Setting the server IP to `0.0.0.0` makes the server reachable at your localhost (this is also the case when the dockerized version is used). In order for the node to reach this server, set the `server_url` setting to `host.docker.internal`.&#x20;

:warning: On the **M1** mac the local server might not be reachable from your nodes as `host.docker.internal` does not seem to refer to the host machine. Reach out to us on Discourse for a solution if you need this!

**Linux**\
****You should bind the server to `0.0.0.0`. In the node configuration files, you can then use `172.17.0.1`, assuming you use the default docker network settings.
