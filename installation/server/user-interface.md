# User Interface

The User Interface (UI) is a web application that aims to make it easy to interact with the server. It allows you to manage all your resources (such as creating collaborations, editing users, or viewing tasks), except for creating new tasks. We aim to incorporate this functionality in the near future.

If you plan on deploying your own server and want to use the UI, follow the installation instructions on the UI [Github page](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6-UI). The UI is an Angular application and as such, you may be required to install _Node.js._ Once you have deployed the UI to the internet, any user that is registered on your vantage6 server will be able to use it.

The UI is not compatible with older versions (<3.3) of vantage6.

If you plan on using the existing Petronas server, you can simply go to [https://portal.petronas.vantage6.ai](https://portal.petronas.vantage6.ai) and login with your user account.
